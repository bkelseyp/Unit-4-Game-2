# Unit-4-Game-2
Here is my crystal collector game. I mixed up the homework assignments last week so that's why I'm turning it in this week.
Also, the bridge on my computer that connecting it to the hard-drive broke. I thought I lost all my files including my homework, Ed extended my homework until Friday, March 15, 2019. I went to the apple store and everything was recovered! 


#About the Game
The player's goal is to match the number in the left pink box. Each crystal holds a specific randomly generated number. 
Click on one of the 4 crystals to see their unique number. Be sure to remember which crystal was clicked and its number. 

#ENJOY!
